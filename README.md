# PrintFarm-Alpha
Klipper print farm set up the labor intensive rather than automatic way. :(

# Abstract
The print farm is a set of 8 highly modified Ender 3 printers at Chattlab that are working toward being controlled via a web interface.  To accomplish this we have installed klipper firmware on the printers and assembled a fleet of chromeboxen running Debian with klipper and moonraker on them.  Additionally, we have set up a Mainsail instance on the main server to coordinate the printers and provide a consistent location fo the interface.

# Methods
We done just used kiauh like madmen and figured it out along the way
